# Project Progress

## Completed Parts (from Roadmap)

- **Project Setup**: Expo project initialized with TypeScript, React Native Paper, ESLint/Prettier, and Git.
- **Supabase Integration**: Supabase project set up, database schema and authentication configured.
- **Authentication Screens**: Login and registration screens implemented (UI present, but flow may need debugging).
- **Android Build & Installation**: APK built and successfully installed on emulator.
- **AuthProvider Refactor**: Authentication context/provider refactored to follow best practices (no navigation logic in provider).

## What To Do Next

1. **Debug Authentication & Loading Flow**
   - Add debug logs in `app/_layout.tsx` to print `authLoading`, `profileLoading`, and `user` values.
   - Confirm that `profileLoading` is set to `false` when appropriate.
   - Check if the `user` is ever set by `AuthProvider`.
2. **Check Supabase Credentials**
   - Ensure Supabase URL and anon key are correct in your config.
3. **Test Profile Fetching**
   - If `user` is set, ensure profile fetch logic works and does not get stuck.
   - If `user` is never set, focus on why the session is not being restored or created.
4. **Continue Roadmap**
   - Once authentication and profile loading are stable, proceed to location services and user profile features.

## Current Problem

- The app is stuck on the loading screen, even after forcing `loading` to `false` in `AuthProvider`.
- The likely cause is that `profileLoading` in the layout is not being set to `false` as expected, or the logic for fetching the user/profile is not progressing.
- There may be issues with Supabase credentials, session persistence, or the logic that sets the user/profile state.

## What Has Been Tried

- Refactored `AuthProvider` to always render children and let the layout handle navigation/loading UI.
- Forced `loading` to `false` in `AuthProvider` for debugging.
- Confirmed that the emulator and APK installation work.
- Attempted to prevent infinite redirects and blank screens by moving all navigation logic to the layout.

---

**Next developer:**
- Start by adding debug logs to `app/_layout.tsx` to trace the state of `authLoading`, `profileLoading`, and `user`.
- Investigate why the loading state never resolves.
- Once fixed, continue with the next steps in the roadmap (location services, user profile, etc.).
