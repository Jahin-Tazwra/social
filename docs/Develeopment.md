This roadmap provides a structured approach to building the app, with clear milestones and deliverables for each phase. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a systematic development process.

## Development Log (AI Session)

### Summary of Changes & Debugging Steps

1. **Android Build & Installation**
   - Guided through building the Android APK and installing it on the emulator using `adb install App.apk`.
   - Ensured the emulator was running and the APK was installed and launched successfully.

2. **AuthProvider Refactor**
   - Replaced the UI that showed Register/Login buttons with an automatic redirect to the login screen if no user is found.
   - Fixed a React Hooks order error by moving the redirect logic into a `useEffect` that always runs, but this caused an infinite redirect loop.
   - Added route segment checks to prevent infinite redirects, but this introduced linter errors due to unsafe array access.
   - Ultimately, removed all redirect logic from `AuthProvider` and let the layout handle navigation and loading UI, as this is best practice.

3. **Loading State Debugging**
   - Forced `loading` to `false` in `AuthProvider` to test if the UI would progress, but the app still showed only the loading screen.
   - Determined that the issue is likely in the layout (`app/_layout.tsx`), where the UI waits for both `authLoading` and `profileLoading` to be `false`.

### Current Issues

- The app is stuck on the loading screen, even after forcing `loading` to `false` in `AuthProvider`.
- The likely cause is that `profileLoading` in the layout is not being set to `false` as expected, or the logic for fetching the user/profile is not progressing.
- There may be issues with Supabase credentials, session persistence, or the logic that sets the user/profile state.

### Where to Continue From

1. **Debug the Layout's Loading Logic**
   - Add debug logs in `app/_layout.tsx` to print the values of `authLoading`, `profileLoading`, and `user`.
   - Confirm that `profileLoading` is being set to `false` when appropriate.
   - Check if the `user` is ever set by `AuthProvider`.

2. **Check Supabase Credentials**
   - Ensure that the Supabase URL and anon key in your config are correct and match your Supabase project.

3. **Test Profile Fetching**
   - If `user` is set, ensure the profile fetch logic works and does not get stuck.
   - If `user` is never set, focus on why the session is not being restored or created.

4. **General Recommendations**
   - Keep all navigation and redirect logic in the layout, not in the provider.
   - Use debug logs to trace state changes and flow.

---

**Next Steps:**
- Add debug logs to `app/_layout.tsx` to trace loading and user state.
- Investigate why `profileLoading` or `authLoading` is not being set to `false`.
- Check Supabase project settings and credentials.
